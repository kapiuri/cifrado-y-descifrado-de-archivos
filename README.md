## file encryption and decryption

## Encrypt a File
Click "Encrypt File": This will open a dialog box for you to select the file you want to encrypt.

Select the file: Navigate to the file you want to encrypt and select it. Then click "Open."

Key Generation: The program will automatically generate an encryption key and use it to encrypt the file.

Saving the Encrypted File and Key:

Encrypted File: The encrypted file will be saved in the same location as the original file, with the .enc extension added to the file name.
Key File: The encryption key is saved in a separate file with the .key extension appended to the original file name. Save this file in a safe place, as you will need it to decrypt the file later.
Success Message: A message will appear informing you that the file has been encrypted and that the key has been saved correctly.


## Decrypt a File
Click "Decrypt File": This will open a dialog box for you to select the encrypted file you want to decrypt.

Select the encrypted file: Navigate to the encrypted file (with the .enc extension) and select it. Then click "Open."

Select the key file: A second dialog box will open to select the key file (.key) that corresponds to the encrypted file.

File Decryption: The program will use the key to decrypt the encrypted file and save the decrypted contents to a new file. The new file will have the same name as the encrypted file, but without the .enc extension.

Success Message: A message will appear informing you that the file has been successfully decrypted and saved to the original location.

## Additional Tips
Save the Key: It is very important to save the key file in a safe place and separate from the encrypted file. Without the key, you will not be able to decrypt the file.
Security: Be sure to use a strong password to protect the key file and the encrypted file if they are stored in locations accessible by other users.
